      <description>Title: Investigating the effectiveness of major Internet protocols in addressing DNS privacy concerns. In this paper I investigate a recent and ongoing problem of DNS privacy. The paper covers in depth analysis of the current issue with DNS privacy, why it is a problem and what the community has proposed to address this issue.
