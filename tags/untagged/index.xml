      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was first introduced to the ’Transport Layer Ossification’ (TLO) phenomenon when I watched a recorded&#xA;presentation by ex-google software engineer Jana Iyengar. In that session, the agenda was mainly around&#xA;QUIC, a new multiplexed transport protocol that was initially designed to enhance the web’s performance and&#xA;in particular HTTP. However QUIC later evolved to be an independent transport protocol that could support&#xA;other domains not just the web. Nevertheless, Jana started by highlighting some context before talking about&#xA;QUIC and in particular the challenges faced when attempting to deploy the Stream Control Transport Protocol&#xA;(SCTP), during that segment Jana explained how middleboxes are powerful enough that they have ossified the&#xA;transport layer making it near impossible to deploy new functional transport protocols. From there I became&#xA;curious to learn about TLO in depth, understand the direct implications on modern-day networks and the&#xA;potential workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
